# CS7434-Snapchat-Filter
3 filters for CS7434 augmented reality - face swap, glasses and moustache

Clone the repo and create a directory in it called "resources". In this, you need the pre-trained face data available here:
http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

Download and extract this to "resources/landmark_predictor.dat"

In resources, place any images you want to use int it for filters (face swap image, moustache image, glasses image); modify the code as appropriate.

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, see here for easy installation with Brew on OSX http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/12/19/install-opencv-3-on-macos-with-homebrew-the-easy-way/

Also make sure you have pip installed with the libraries dlib and numpy. Install any others as required.
